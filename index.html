<p style="text-align:center">And itâ€™s <em>really</em> a great website - clean and simple.</p>
<p>The Doggone Minimal Website is a <u>single web page template</u> that was inspired by other, foul-mouthed websites. The template for this web page came from the "Perfect 'Foul-Mouthed' Website.com" who kindly gave permission for others to do with it whatever they pleased. So, I took out the foul-mouthed parts.</p>

## Welcome to the GitHub Pages page for crrdlx

#### *I'm relatively new to GitHub and using the following repos to learn about it and open source in general.*
----
#### Grin Converter

This was my first attempt at an open source project.

Grin Converter repository: [https://github.com/crrdlx/grin-converter](https://github.com/crrdlx/grin-converter)

The app simply converts the current price of Grin into fiat various fiat currencies.
* The web app can be found online at [http://br549.mywebcommunity.org/grin/](http://br549.mywebcommunity.org/grin/)
* The Android app is available in the Google Play store at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grin.converter">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grin.converter</a>
* This is a simple standalone app. But, it's also built into the "Satoshi Bitcoin Converter." The Satoshi app not only handles Grin, but has other cryptos too. See below.

#### Satoshi Bitcoin Converter

I also made the Satoshi Bitcoin Converter app for Android (not open source, maybe one day). It is available at [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.satoshi.bitcoin.converter&hl=en_US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.satoshi.bitcoin.converter&hl=en_US) The "sales pitch" follows. There's really no sales since the app is free, actually, and has no ads. I get nothing from it except a sense of accomplisment and a few thanks, which are awesome!

The Satoshi Bitcoin Converter automatically switches units between bitcoin, mBTC, uBTC, and satoshi. A current value is displayed in major currencies. Maybe you've wondered how many u-bits are in an m-bit, or, how much bitcoin is that 15,000 satoshi? Or, what's all that worth right now anyway in fiat currency? Then this may be a useful app for you. 

Note: this app is not for fiat-to-fiat conversion, like USD-to-EUR. And it is not for crypto-to-crypto conversion, like Bitcoin-to-Dash. This app is for fiat-to-crypto conversions.

Ethereum unit conversion is included: Ether, Finney, Szabo, and Gwei units.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Dash (DASH), NEO (NEO), NeoGAS (GAS), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Grin (GRIN) support have been included as well. 

Supported currencies: USD, GBP, EUR, CNY, CAD, AUD, INR, JPY, KRW, and many others.

#### PureCSS
This is a template from Yahoo! for a responsive website. It looks good on a desktop/laptop, tablet, or phone. I'm trying to mash it up with the Doggone Minimal Website.
PureCSS repository: [https://github.com/crrdlx/purecss](https://github.com/crrdlx/purecss) or it can be viewed live online at: [PureCSS example](http://br549.mywebcommunity.org/pure/)

#### Doggone Minimal Website

The "DMW" is a template for a simple, clean, one-page website. It fits and looks great on any browser.
The DMW repository is here: [https://github.com/crrdlx/doggone-minimal-website](https://github.com/crrdlx/doggone-minimal-website)

Better, the DMW can be viewed at this link: [Doggone Minimal Website in action](https://crrdlx.github.io/pages/dmw.html)
