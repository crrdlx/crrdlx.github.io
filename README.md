### Being rather new to GitHub, I'm using the following repos to learn about it.

#### PureCSS
This is a template from Yahoo! for a responsive website. It looks good on a desktop/laptop, tablet, or phone. I'm trying to mash it up with the Doggone Minimal Website sort or embedded.
PureCSS repository: [https://github.com/crrdlx/purecss](https://github.com/crrdlx/purecss)

#### Doggone Minimal Website

The "DMW" is a template for a simple, clean, one-page website. It fits and looks great on any browser.

The DMW repository is here: [https://github.com/crrdlx/doggone-minimal-website](https://github.com/crrdlx/doggone-minimal-website)
