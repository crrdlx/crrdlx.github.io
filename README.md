## Welcome to the GitHub Pages page for crrdlx

### I'm new to GitHub and using the following repos to learn about it and open source in general.

#### Grin Converter

Grin Converter repository: [https://github.com/crrdlx/grin-converter](https://github.com/crrdlx/grin-converter)

The app simply converts the current price of Grin into fiat various fiat currencies.

* The Android app is available in the Google Play store at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grin.converter">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grin.converter</a>

#### PureCSS
This is a template from Yahoo! for a responsive website. It looks good on a desktop/laptop, tablet, or phone. I'm trying to mash it up with the Doggone Minimal Website.

#### Doggone Minimal Website

The "DMW" is a template for a simple, clean, one-page website. It fits and looks great on any browser.
The DMW repository is here: [https://github.com/crrdlx/doggone-minimal-website](https://github.com/crrdlx/doggone-minimal-website)

#### Satoshi Bitcoin Converter

I also made the Satoshi Bitcoin Converter app for Android (not open source, maybe one day). It is available at [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.satoshi.bitcoin.converter&hl=en_US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.satoshi.bitcoin.converter&hl=en_US) The "sales pitch" (it's free) follows:

Satoshi Bitcoin Converter automatically switches units between bitcoin, mBTC, uBTC, and satoshi. A current value is displayed in major currencies. Maybe you've wondered how many u-bits are in an m-bit, or, how much bitcoin is that 15,000 satoshi? Or, what's all that worth right now anyway in fiat currency? Then this may be a useful app for you. 

Note: this app is not for fiat-to-fiat conversion, like USD-to-EUR. And it is not for crypto-to-crypto conversion, like Bitcoin-to-Dash. This app is for fiat-to-crypto conversions.

Ethereum unit conversion is included: Ether, Finney, Szabo, and Gwei units.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Dash (DASH), NEO (NEO), NeoGAS (GAS), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Grin (GRIN) support have been included as well. 

Supported currencies: USD, GBP, EUR, CNY, CAD, AUD, INR, JPY, KRW, and many others.
